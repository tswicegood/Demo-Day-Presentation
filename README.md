# A guide to presenting on demo day

## Format

We do a “science fair” Demo Day at the Iron Yard in Austin. This means that you and the rest of the cohort will each have an assigned space to setup and demo your project. Folks who attend the Demo Day will wander around from demo to demo to see what everybody has done.

We’ve found this format preferable to an on-stage demo in front of the audience. It’s lower stress and lends itself an interactive Q&A with folks who are interested in your project and you. There’s a wide range of attendees: from CTOs and Directors of Design to HR to folks who are simply interested in The Iron Yard and want to see what y’all have created. Be prepared to change the focus of your talk. Some folks are going to want to dive into the technical aspects while others want to stay high-level talking about the product you’ve created or the process you went through here at The Iron Yard in Austin. Be ready to chat about it all.

The best way to prepare for everything is to put together a short — *three minutes or less!* — presentation about your product. Practice this so that it becomes second nature, then jumping from technical to high-level and back won’t be a problem because you’ll know how to talk about your project.

Remember…

### 3 minutes long!

Your goal is to get as much of the following information in those three minutes. You might not be able to do it all, but be as efficient as possible with your words. Three minutes is not a long time.

## Content

Every time I start trying to put together a presentation I watch [this TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?language=en) and try to structure my presentation based on "the golden circle". 

1. Introduce yourself (the "why")
	- Tell the audience your name and briefly talk about your background before TIY.
	- Talk about why you picked the project that you did. Ideally this will be in story form (5-6 sentences) focusing on your connection to the topic and the problem that you're solving or other motivating reason for picking this topic. Out of all of the possible ideas, why did you pick this one? Bonus points if your story relates back to your introduction of yourself in some way.

2. Talk about your process (the "how")
	- Talk about the process you went through to come up with your idea and how you executed it. You won't always be speaking to a technical audience, so "the how" should tease at the technical aspects while not totally overwhelming an HR person with no programming experience. If someone is interested in your tech specifically, they will ask for more details. Give those tech people something to ask about if they're curious, but don't spend too much time on it.
	- Talk about all of the other aspects of how your final project came to fruition. Weave in any relavent experiences that you had throughout the course that informed how you approached the project. Did you learn anything from the group project or client project that you used in your final project?
	- Feel free to talk about user stories, wire frames, data modeling, etc. These are all parts of your process.

3. Talk about your project (the "what")
	- Pulling the first two points together, tell your audience what your final product is. This should be a *one sentence description* of what your thing does. The goal here is to give them context but it's much better to show "what" you made rather than try to explain it.
	- Demo your product. Try to maintain eye contact with the audience, don't hunch over the keyboard. Make sure you are pre-logged in. Nobody cares that you can log in, that is assumed.
	- The best demos are in story form. "Imagine Sally is going to the grocery store for the first time after discovering she has a food allergy..." and proceed to walk them through the features of your app. As the character in your story encounters a problem show how the app can help to solve it.

4. End on a strong note
	- Don't end with something like "that's it." Saying that de-values all the hard work you did. A good way to close the "presentation" part of your conversation is by asking "can I answer any questions?"

## Presentation tips

1. Smile! Your app can be crashing and burning behind you with all the bugs in the world, but if you are smiling you audience won't know the difference and everything will work out fine.
1. Choose your words wisely. Since you have such a short period of time you don't want to waste time on long, irrelevant tangents.
2. Practice slowing down your tempo. This might seem counter intuitive, but you want to speak at the same rate as the brain of your slowest audience member can process. If you speak faster than your brain can process you'll end up wasting a lot of time saying "umm..." and "like..."
3. Go with the flow. If an audience member asks a question in the middle of your presentation, take the conversation where they want it to go. *The best thing that can happen is your audience asks a lot of questions.* This means that they are engaged and are interested in what you're saying. Don't kill this vibe, roll with it.
4. Make good eye contact and assume a confident posture. Not only will this reflect well on you, but it will also [make you more confident](https://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_shapes_who_you_are?language=en). Don't hunch over. Take up space with your body. Use lots of gestures.
5. Don't speak in a monotone voice. Show that you are excited about all of this work that you did!
